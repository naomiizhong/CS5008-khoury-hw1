How many hours did it take you to complete this assignment (estimate)? 8 hours.

Did you collaborate with any other students/TAs/Professors? If so, tell us who and in what capacity.  
  - not this time, but looking forward to collaborating in the future.


Did you use any external resources (you do not have to cite in class material)? (Cite them below)  
  - github docs on git commit and git push.


(Optional) What was your favorite part of the assignment? 
  - learning how to commit.

(Optional) How would you improve the assignment? 


## Learning Questions

* In C, do you use printf or print? 
  - printf

* What operating system do you use? 
  - mac

* What did you end up doing to get C working on your system?
  - Clang was already installed on my machine, so it was fairly easy to get C working. I mainly coded on the Khoury Server.

* Markdown is a common standard to format text, particularly due to the popularity of github. Take a moment to review a github guide or two, and then write a few basic examples of markdown in the 'markdown playground' section below. You need to include both code and some formatting content on the examples. Make sure to view this readme in browser (your github repo) to see how it renders. 

* Computer science ends up becoming more "exploration" based as you progress. This assignment required a lot of exploration and learning the correct thing to setup / install - which is all unique based on your systems. This is common in the industry, even if it can be frustrating for a student just learning. 
   * Reflect a bit on why that would be the case for computer science? Include in your reflection some "habits" you can develop to help better that process of exploration and learning. Please include at least a paragraph for this reflection.
   - Computer Science requires explorative learning becasue it is a burgeoning subject that constantly welcomes new theories, languages, discoveries and innovations. The subject of computer science evolves so fast that a textbook written just a few years ago can become outdated if new editions are not followed promptly. That's why sometimes a stackflow post can be more helpful than books. CS as a subject is intrinsically crowd-sourced.
   - As a former philosophy major, learning cs initially posed some challenges. Throughout the process two habits helped me the most: 1) focus on the details, if they don't matter now, they will matter one day; 2) prioritizing following through than reflecting on a small point and thus breaking the flow.
